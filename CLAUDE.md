This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Project Overview

MCP Gateway is an Envoy-based gateway for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It consists of two separate binaries with four components:

**`cmd/mcp-broker-router/main.go`** — data-plane binary running:
- **MCP Router**: Envoy external processor that routes MCP requests (gRPC on :50051)
- **MCP Broker**: HTTP service that aggregates tools from multiple MCP servers (HTTP on :8080/mcp)

**`cmd/main.go`** — control-plane binary running:
- **MCP Gateway Controller**: Kubernetes controller that discovers MCP servers via MCPServerRegistration and MCPVirtualServer CRDs
- **MCP Gateway Operator**: Kubernetes controller that reconciles MCPGatewayExtension resources and deploys instances of the MCP Router and MCP Broker to form a working MCP Gateway instance

### Not Implemented
- Resource federation (only tools and prompts currently)

# Exploration

To explore the code base, if the codebase-memory-mcp is configured, index the project and use this MCP server and use its tools to explore the project as much as possible.

## Architecture

```
Client → Gateway (Envoy) → Router (ext_proc) → Broker → Upstream MCP Servers
                ↑                                 ↑
           Controller → Secret ──────────────────┘
```

- Controller watches MCPServerRegistration CRDs, discovers backends via HTTPRoutes, writes config Secret
- Broker reads config Secret, connects to upstream servers, federates tools with prefixes
- Router parses MCP requests, adds auth headers, tells Envoy where to route
- Tool Calls use a lazy initialization model where the router hairpins an initialize request back through Envoy to the backend MCP Server before continuing with the MCP tool call. This ensures initialization is only done when needed and that policies are applied to both the initialize and tool/call requests.
- All MCP traffic flows through Envoy for consistent policies

- Overview Documentation: `docs/design/overview.md`

### Core Components

- `Router`: ext_proc server that parses MCP Requests and routes the request to the correct MCP Backend
- `Broker`: default MCP Backend for the Gateway. It handles initialize and tool/list requests. Manages session initialization for the MCP Gateway. Serves aggregated tools for the gateway and handles backend MCP Server discovery and integration.
- `controller`: Kubernetes-based controller that manages the CRDs defined by the code in `api/v1alpha1`
- `operator`: Kubernetes-based controller that is responsible for deploying instances of the router and broker which together form the MCP Gateway

**Important**: We use Istio ONLY as a Gateway API provider, NOT as a service mesh:
- No sidecars on any workload pods
- No ambient mode (no ztunnels or waypoint proxies)
- Just `istiod` programming the Gateway's Envoy proxy
- ServiceEntry/DestinationRule only used for external service routing

### External Services

The controller detects external services by checking the HTTPRoute backendRef kind:
- `kind: Hostname` with `group: networking.istio.io` → treated as an external service, URL built directly from the hostname
- `kind: Service` (default) → treated as an internal Kubernetes service, URL built from `{name}.{namespace}.svc.cluster.local`

Users must create the Istio ServiceEntry, DestinationRule, and HTTPRoute resources for external services. See `docs/guides/external-mcp-server.md` for detailed instructions.

### Authentication

There are two separate auth paths:

1. **Broker → upstream** (`credentialRef`): The broker uses credentials from the MCPServerRegistration's `credentialRef` secret to connect to upstream MCP servers for tool listing and session management. This credential is NEVER injected into client `tools/call` requests. The router does not have access to `credentialRef`.

2. **Client → upstream** (`tools/call`): Client tool call requests are routed by the router directly to the backend via Envoy. Clients must authenticate through one of:
   - AuthPolicy applied to the Gateway/HTTPRoute (e.g. OIDC, API key)
   - URL token elicitation (`tokenURLElicitation`) — user submits a token via the token page, cached and injected by the router
   - Client-provided headers passed through by the router during session initialization

Users can apply different AuthPolicies per MCP Server since each server has its own HTTPRoute. There can be two layers: (1) a policy on the Gateway route / MCP Broker endpoints, (2) a distinct policy on a listener or HTTPRoute for a specific MCP server (e.g. a PAT for GitHub MCP access).

## Development

### Code Style

- Minimal, DRY, terse comments (lowercase, only when necessary)
- Idiomatic Go, leverage interfaces where appropriate
- No emojis or AI-style formatting
- Files must end with newline
- Regularly run make lint to check for lint errors.
- When adding or changing CRD fields in `api/v1alpha1/`, update the corresponding API reference doc in `docs/reference/` to reflect the change.

- [ ] E2E tests go in `tests/e2e/` using Ginkgo and are defined in a markdown file `tests/e2e/test_cases.md`
- [ ] E2E tests use direct port-forwards to `deployment/mcp-gateway`
- [ ] E2E tests clean up resources before creating them
- [ ] Test servers live in `tests/servers/` — create new ones for specific test scenarios

### Running Tests
```bash
make lint               # Run all lint and style checks
make test-unit          # Unit tests
make test-controller-integration  # Controller integration tests (envtest)
```

### Version References
Docs and scripts on `main` always reference the latest published release version (plain SemVer, e.g., `0.5.1`). Git refs use a `v` prefix (e.g., `v${MCP_GATEWAY_VERSION}`), Helm `--version` uses bare SemVer. The `scripts/set-release-version.sh` script updates all version references and is run as part of the release process and the post-release bump on `main`.

## Concurrency

Before using a mutex to protect memory access, consider whether golang channels are a better solution. Favour the principle of sharing memory by communicating rather than communicating via shared memory.

## Performance

Broker and router are hot paths. Avoid allocations in per-request code.

- Use pointer maps (`map[string]*T`) not value maps -- value lookups copy the struct
- Use `for i := range` not `for _, v := range` on large structs in hot loops
- Use structured logging (`logger.Info("msg", "key", val)`) not `fmt.Sprintf`
- Use `logger.Debug` for per-request logging, `logger.Info` for lifecycle events only
- Avoid expensive argument construction (e.g., `fmt.Sprintf`) in span attribute calls on hot paths; the OTel SDK already no-ops `SetAttributes` on non-recording spans
- Use injected `logger`, never package-level `slog.Info`/`slog.Error`

Profiling: pprof on port 6060. See `tests/perf/` for load testing scripts and methodology.
